Based on the user command "turn on the light", I assume that the user wants to turn on the light in the room they are currently located, which is the living room based on the current state of the system.

Here's the updated JSON format with the device state changed:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {
    "lights": {
      "overhead": {
        "state": "on"
      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "on"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As a result of the user's command, both the overhead light and the lamp in the living room are turned on. The bedside lamp in the bedroom remains off as it was not specified in the user's command.

Here is the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format, after the user issued the command to turn on the light:

```
{
    "user": {
        "location": "living_room"
    },
    "bedroom": {
        "lights": {
            "bedside_lamp": {
                "state": "off"
            }
        }
    },
    "living_room": {
        "lights": {
            "overhead": {
                "state": "on"
            },
            "lamp": {
                "state": "on"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As the user did not specify which light to turn on, I assumed that they meant to turn on all the lights in the room where they are located, which is the living room in this case. Therefore, I changed the state of both the "overhead" and "lamp" lights to "on". The state of the "bedside_lamp" in the bedroom was not changed as it was not mentioned in the user's command.

Based on the user command, it is not clear which specific light the user wants to turn on. Therefore, I will assume that the user wants to turn on the overhead light in the living room.

Here is the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format:

```
{
    "user": {
        "location": "living_room"
    },
    "bedroom": {
        "lights": {
            "bedside_lamp": {
                "state": "off"
            }
        }
    },
    "living_room": {
        "lights": {
            "overhead": {
                "state": "on"
            },
            "lamp": {
                "state": "off"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, the "state" of the "overhead" light in the "living_room" has been changed to "on".

Based on the current state of the devices in the home and the user's command, the appropriate device to turn on would be the "overhead" light in the "living_room". Here is the updated state of the devices in JSON format:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {
    "lights": {
      "overhead": {
        "state": "on"
      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
``` 

Note that the state of the "overhead" light in the "living_room" has been changed from "off" to "on", while the states of the other devices remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format, after the user's command:

```
{
    "user": {
        "location": "living_room"
    },
    "bedroom": {
        "lights": {
            "bedside_lamp": {
                "state": "off"
            }
        }
    },
    "living_room": {
        "lights": {
            "overhead": {
                "state": "on"
            },
            "lamp": {
                "state": "on"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I assume that the user wants to turn on all the lights in the current room, which is the living room according to the current state. Therefore, I have changed the state of the living room lights accordingly. The overhead light and the lamp are both turned on. The state of the bedroom light (bedside lamp) is not changed, as it is not in the current location of the user.

Based on the user's command, I need to determine which light to turn on, considering the user's current location. Here is the updated JSON format based on the command and the current state of the devices in the home:

Input:
```
{"user": {"location": "living_room"}, "bedroom": {"lights": {"bedside_lamp": {"state": "off"}}}, "living_room": {"lights": {"overhead": {"state": "off"}, "lamp": {"state": "off"}}}}
```

Output:
```
{"user": {"location": "living_room"}, "bedroom": {"lights": {"bedside_lamp": {"state": "off"}}}, "living_room": {"lights": {"overhead": {"state": "on"}, "lamp": {"state": "off"}}}}
```

Based on the user's location in the living room, I have turned on the overhead light in the living room, while leaving the bedside lamp and lamp in the bedroom off as they were before.

Here is the updated state of the devices in the home after executing the user's command, in JSON format:

```
{
    "user": {
        "location": "living_room"
    },
    "bedroom": {
        "lights": {
            "bedside_lamp": {
                "state": "off"
            }
        }
    },
    "living_room": {
        "lights": {
            "overhead": {
                "state": "on"
            },
            "lamp": {
                "state": "on"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

I have assumed that the user intends to turn on all the lights in the current room, which is the living room based on their location. Therefore, I have changed the "state" of the "overhead" and "lamp" lights in the "living_room" section to "on". If the user intended to turn on only a specific light or lights, more information would be needed to determine which ones to change.

Here is the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {
    "lights": {

      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "on"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Assuming that the user is currently located in the living room, the AI would turn on both the overhead light and the lamp in that room. If the user were located in a different room, the AI would need to identify the appropriate light to turn on based on the user's location.

Based on the given JSON format and the user command, the device state will be changed as follows:

{"user": {"location": "living_room"}, "bedroom": {"lights": {"bedside_lamp": {"state": "off"}}}, "living_room": {"lights": {"overhead": {"state": "on"}, "lamp": {"state": "off"}}}}

The response in JSON format would be as shown above, where the "overhead" light in the "living_room" is turned on while the "bedside_lamp" and "lamp" in the "bedroom" and "living_room" respectively remain off as they were not specified in the user command.

Based on the current state of the devices, it is not clear which light the user wants to turn on. Therefore, I will assume that the user intends to turn on the living room overhead light. Here is the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {
    "lights": {
      "overhead": {
        "state": "on"
      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the state of the living room overhead light has been changed from "off" to "on". The state of the other devices has not been changed, as they were not relevant to the user's command.
