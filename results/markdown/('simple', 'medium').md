Here's the updated JSON format with the devices' new state:

```
{
   "user":{
      "location":"living_room"
   },
   "bedroom":{
      "lights":{
         "bedside_lamp":{
            "state":"off"
         }
      }
   },
   "living_room":{
      "lights":{
         "overhead":{
            "state":"on"
         },
         "lamp":{
            "state":"on"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

After receiving the command "get ready for a party," I assumed that the user wants to turn on the lights in the living room to create a more festive atmosphere. Therefore, I turned on both the overhead light and the lamp in the living room. Since the user's location is already in the living room, there is no need to change that. The bedside lamp in the bedroom was already off, so I did not make any changes there.

Here's the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format, after processing the command "get ready for a party":

```
{
    "user": {"location": "living_room"},
    "bedroom": {"lights": {"bedside_lamp": {"state": "off"}}},
    "living_room": {
        "lights": {
            "overhead": {"state": "on"},
            "lamp": {"state": "on"}
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation:

- The user is currently located in the living room, so that is where we will focus our changes.
- We assume that "getting ready for a party" means turning on all the lights in the living room, so we set the state of both the overhead light and the lamp to "on".
- We leave the state of the bedside lamp in the bedroom unchanged, as it is not relevant to the command.

Here's the updated state of the devices in the smart home, in JSON format, after processing the user's command:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {
    "lights": {
      "overhead": {
        "state": "on"
      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "on"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation: 

Assuming the command "get ready for a party" means turning on the lights in the living room, we update the state of the "overhead" and "lamp" lights in the "living_room" section to "on". We also leave the state of the "bedside_lamp" in the "bedroom" section as "off" since it was not mentioned in the command.

      }
    },
    "music": {
      "state": "on",
      "playlist": "party"
    }
  }
}
```

        "lights": {
            "overhead": {
                "state": "on"
            },

                "state": "on"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In response to the command, the AI has turned on the overhead light and the lamp in the living room, assuming that these are the lights that would provide the appropriate lighting for a party. The bedside lamp in the bedroom has been left off, assuming that it is not needed for the party.

Here's the updated state of the devices in the home, in JSON format:

```
{
  "user": {
    "location": "living_room"
  },
  "bedroom": {
    "lights": {
      "bedside_lamp": {
        "state": "off"
      }
    }
  },
  "living_room": {

      },
      "lamp": {
        "state": "on"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Explanation: The command "get ready for a party" implies that the living room needs to be prepared for a party. Therefore, I have turned on the living room's overhead light and lamp to create a brighter atmosphere. The bedroom's bedside lamp is already off, so there is no need to change its state.
